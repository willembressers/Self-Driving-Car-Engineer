# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build` (only the first time)
3. Compile & Run it: `./compile_and_run.sh`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Rubric points

### Compilation

#### The code compiles correctly.
Code must compile without errors with cmake and make.

Given that we've made CMakeLists.txt as general as possible, it's recommend that you do not change it unless you can guarantee that your changes will still compile on any platform.

As show in the screenshot, the building and compilation din't gave any errors
![Compile and run](./images/compile_and_run.png)

### Valid Trajectories

#### The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident..
The top right screen of the simulator shows the current/best miles driven without incident. Incidents include exceeding acceleration/jerk/speed, collision, and driving outside of the lanes. Each incident case is also listed below in more detail.

Although we've had quite some traffic in front of use, and had no possibilities to pass. We've made it until 4.53 (and still going strong) without any accidents or any jerks.
![Compile and run](./images/finish.png)

#### The car drives according to the speed limit.
The car doesn't drive faster than the speed limit. Also the car isn't driving much slower than speed limit unless obstructed by traffic.

I've hardcoded the max speed just below the speed limit.
```c++
// convert [mp/h -> m/s] = / 2.237
  double max_speed = 49.5 / 2.237;
  double speed_limit = 50 / 2.237;
```

#### Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.
The car does not exceed a total acceleration of 10 m/s^2 and a jerk of 10 m/s^3.

I'm not sure if accelerations and jerks are logged, but there were none during the ride.

#### Car does not have collisions.
The car must not come into contact with any of the other cars on the road.

I'm not sure if collisions are logged, but there were none during the ride.

#### The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
The car doesn't spend more than a 3 second length out side the lane lanes during changing lanes, and every other time the car stays inside one of the 3 lanes on the right hand side of the road.

it does.

#### The car is able to change lanes
The car is able to smoothly change lanes when it makes sense to do so, such as when behind a slower moving car and an adjacent lane is clear of other traffic.

## Reflection
#### There is a reflection on how to generate paths.

The code model for generating paths is described in detail. This can be part of the README or a separate doc labeled "Model Documentation".

The main code consist of 4 parts:

1. **process sensory data**; in the first part, the car processes the sensory data it recieves. This parts analyses the sensory input and sets the appropriate flags (car in front, left lane available, etc).
2. **behaviour**; in the behaviour part, the car makes a decision on it's actions. if it wants to adjust it's speed or change a lane
3. **trajectory**; now that an decision is made, the car plans a trajectory for it's action. This means it determines it path it want to follow
4. **path planner**; in the last part the desired trajectory is translated to an spline in real world coordinates so the car follows the lane (curvature) and doesn't jerk the car.

this was fun. :D
